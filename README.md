## Usage & Deployment

### Web Deployment
- **Build for production:**
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
- **Preview production build:**
  ```sh
  npm run preview
  ```
- **Deploy** to your preferred static host (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) or use [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) for instant deployment.

### Android (Capacitor) Integration & Deployment

#### 1. Add Android Platform
```sh
npx cap add android
```

#### 2. Sync Web Assets to Android
```sh
npm run build
npx cap sync android
```

#### 3. Open in Android Studio
```sh
npx cap open android
```
- Build, run, and test the app on an emulator or device.

#### 4. Common Capacitor Commands
- **Sync after changes:**
  ```sh
  npx cap sync
  ```
- **Copy assets only:**
  ```sh
  npx cap copy
  ```
- **Update plugins:**
  ```sh
  npx cap update
  ```

#### 5. Android Build Notes
- Ensure Android Studio is installed and configured.
- You may need to update package names, icons, and splash screens in `android/app/src/main/res/`.
- For push notifications, deep linking, or other native features, refer to [Capacitor docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs).

---

## Supabase Integration
- All authentication, database, and real-time features are powered by Supabase.
- Database schema is defined in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Edge functions (e.g., notifications) are in `supabase/functions/`.
- Update Supabase credentials in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`.

## Android Native Google Auth (Credential Manager)

- This app uses a native Capacitor plugin for Google sign-in on Android, using the Credential Manager bottomsheet UI.
- You must set your Google Web Client ID in `GoogleAuthPlugin.java` (`<YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID>` placeholder).
- Make sure your Android app is registered in the Google Cloud Console and the correct client IDs are in `google-services.json`.
- The plugin is auto-registered in `MainActivity.java`.
- On Android, the sign-in flow will use the native bottomsheet and return the ID token to the web layer, which is then used to authenticate with Supabase.

---

## Local Capacitor Plugin: GoogleAuthPlugin

This project uses a custom Capacitor plugin for Google sign-in on Android, implemented as a local plugin in the `plugins/google-auth-plugin` directory. If you need to update or debug the native sign-in, edit the Java code in `plugins/google-auth-plugin/android/src/main/java/com/buildcore/googleauth/GoogleAuthPlugin.java`.

To install or update the plugin:
1. Run `npm install ./plugins/google-auth-plugin`
2. Run `npx cap sync android`
3. Rebuild your Android project in Android Studio.

In JS, use:
```js
import { registerPlugin } from '@capacitor/core';
const GoogleAuthPlugin = registerPlugin('GoogleAuthPlugin');
```
